Welcome to the Minimum Separation Vector Mapping (MSVM) project! This repository contains the implementation of an innovative [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) approach developed by Ultralytics for geospatial information fusion and video analytics. MSVM is designed to enhance situational awareness in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) applications, showcasing early work in advanced [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) techniques.

## üìë Description

The MSVM technique, originally presented in our SPIE Defense + Security 2014 paper, utilizes sophisticated algorithms to map and analyze motion imagery specifically for ISR tasks. This method focuses on fusing geospatial data with video streams to provide deeper insights. For a comprehensive understanding, please consult the original publication:

Jocher, G., et al. "Minimum Separation Vector Mapping (MSVM)." Proc. SPIE 9089, Geospatial InfoFusion and Video Analytics IV; and Motion Imagery for ISR and Situational Awareness II, 90890A (2014). [DOI: 10.1117/12.2053833](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2053833)

## üîß Requirements

To run the MSVM codebase, you need [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or newer, along with specific toolboxes. Follow these setup steps:

1.  **Clone Common Functions:** Get the Ultralytics common MATLAB functions repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
    ```

2.  **Add to MATLAB Path:** Add the cloned repository directory to your MATLAB environment path using this command in MATLAB:
    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('/path/to/functions-matlab'))
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/functions-matlab` with the actual path where you cloned the repository.

3.  **Install Required Toolboxes:** Ensure the following MATLAB toolboxes are installed:
    -   `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
    -   `Signal Processing Toolbox`

These toolboxes provide essential functions used by the MSVM algorithms.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Code

To execute the MSVM estimators, open MATLAB, navigate to the project directory, and run the main script:

```matlab
runEstimators
```

This command will start the MSVM analysis process, generating output related to geospatial information fusion and video analytics based on the provided data.

Here is an example visualization of the expected results:
