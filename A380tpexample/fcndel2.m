function v = fcndel2(f,varargin)
%DEL2 Discrete Laplacian.
%   L = DEL2(U), when U is a matrix, is a discrete approximation of
%   0.25*del^2 u = (d^2u/dx^2 + d^2u/dy^2)/4.  The matrix L is the same
%   size as U, with each element equal to the difference between an 
%   element of U and the average of its four neighbors.
%
%   L = DEL2(U), when U is an N-D array, returns an approximation of
%   (del^2 u)/2/n, where n is ndims(u).
%
%   L = DEL2(U,H), where H is a scalar, uses H as the spacing between
%   points in each direction (H=1 by default).
%
%   L = DEL2(U,HX,HY), when U is 2-D, uses the spacing specified by HX
%   and HY. If HX is a scalar, it gives the spacing between points in
%   the x-direction. If HX is a vector, it must be of length SIZE(U,2)
%   and specifies the x-coordinates of the points.  Similarly, if HY
%   is a scalar, it gives the spacing between points in the
%   y-direction. If HY is a vector, it must be of length SIZE(U,1) and
%   specifies the y-coordinates of the points.
%
%   L = DEL2(U,HX,HY,HZ,...), when U is N-D, uses the spacing given by
%   HX, HY, HZ, etc. 
%
%   Class support for input U:
%      float: double, single
%
